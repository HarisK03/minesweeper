## About The Project ##

The purpose of our game, Minesweeper, is to captivate the attention of younger audiences by engaging them in a puzzling objective that strengthens skills related to logic, arithmetic, and algebra. It has come to our attention that younger generations seem to be lacking a sense of problem-solving skills and mathematical ability, both of which are crucial skills that are essential to maintain throughout the course of one’s education, job and overall future lifestyle. This is what led us to create Minesweeper because it will revolutionize the educational journey for younger audience’s by providing them with an engaging tool that will help grasp key learning skills at a young age.

## Getting Started ##

This application will allow the user to play Minesweeper in a 9x9 board where they race against the clock.

### Installation ###

1.	Visit the download page [here](https://github.com/HarisK03/minesweeper/ "Download Minesweeper")
2.	Expand the `Download Code` drag down menu and click the `Download ZIP` button
3.	Extract the downloaded package and move it to the desired location on your PC
4.	Download Java SDK if not already installed from [here](https://www.java.com/en/ "Download Java SDK")
5.	Locate and open the Minesweeper.bat file (Microsoft Windows) or the Minesweeper.sh file (Apple MacOS) from the download .zip file

### Tutorial ###

1.	Upon arriving at the main menu of Minesweeper, you can press “New Game” to begin playing!
2.	The objective upon starting a game is to clear the board of all tiles that do not contain mines by selecting them. You can begin playing by selecting a tile anywhere on the board.
3.	Upon selecting a tile, the board will flood by opening more tiles. These tiles will have a number stamped on them, which indicates the number of mines touching that tile. Strategically choose what mine to select next by taking these numbers into account.
4.	Right-click any tiles that you think contain mines. This will put a flag on that tile, so you can keep track of what tiles have mines. (Note: carefully place the flags because it will be difficult to clear the board if you flag a tile that does not contain a mine). Additionally, you can place question marks of suspected mines by right clicking twice.
5.	The timer at the bottom of the game screen indicates the time elapsed during the game. The time is used as a scorekeeping element (Note: faster time = better score). The fastest time will be displayed as the high score.
6.	Win the game by selecting all the tiles that do not contain mines. Question marks or blank tiles will not suffice. Flags are required!
7.	If you select a tile that contains a mine, then you will lose the game. It will reveal all mine locations for a brief period before exiting to the loss screen.
